So I ordered my lunch, the delivery gal had come and dropped it off and went on about her way. ⁣ ⁣ A few seconds later as I’m About to eat I hear another knock on the door. I answer it and it’s the delivery gal. She ask “I see the decals on your car. I was wondering if you rode”. I told her yes I do. She then went on to tell me she’s got some tack in her car and asked if I was interested. I asked what style tack was it. She replied with western, my riding style. ⁣ ⁣ She started naming off all the tack she had and I told her I’d take it all. I went back in to unlock my car and asked her to put it all in the back of my seat. ⁣ ⁣ At the end of it all getting 12 garlic Parmesan bone in wings, 6 mild buffalo bone in wings, 2 ranch cups, a barrel saddle, two halters (in new condition), two saddle pads, pair of gaming boots, breast collar, barrel reins, girth totaling up to no less then $1000 worth of tack was the best $40 I ever spent. ⁣ ⁣ #pizzahut #girlandhorses #score #happy #westernstyle #barrelsaddle #girth #breastcollar #barrelreins #gamingboots #saddlepads #wings #horse #dealoftheday #excited",

A few of my friends wanted to join in on the search for a good PHILLY CHEESESTEAK sandwich and we started with Woody's because they are open late. I ordered their PHILLY CHEESTEAK with onions along with some chips and a cold and crisp coke. The sandwich itself felt a bit dry and I wished it had more cheese. The bread is good but a bit too thick for my taste, taking a big bite will need to be followed by a sip of that cold and delicious coca-cola. Now, here is the good about the place... the meat itself is very tasty and they are very generous with the amount of meat you get on your sandwich. You have a COCA-COLA fountain you can get up and self serve yourself some refills if needed. Although the place is small and has limited parking, I don't see parking being a problem because there is parking all around the surrounding area. There are plenty of tables inside and out to sit at so if you're by yourself or with a larger group, you can find the right table. The place is open until midnight on Sun-Thu and open until 4AM on Fri and Sat which is great!!!! You always have to think \"how much did I get for my money\" and for a $7 sandwich, Woody's is definitely a spot to stop by if you're hungry, in the area and it's late. Check them out and let me know what you think!!! #phillycheesesteak #philly #cheesesteak #sandwiches #coke #cocacola #cocacolalover #cocacolafountain #sharinghappiness #cheapeats #latenightsnack #foodie #foodsofinstagram #tasty #atlanta #atlantafood #riderswhoeat #honda #bmw #yamaha #cb #cb1000r #hondacb1000r #mt09 #s1000xr #woodys #wheretogo #alwayshungry @roliridesandeats",

I use this product once a week and I am impressed by it, I don’t think it’s a show stopper but does the job in terms of what it suggests. I’d recommend using for ages 25 and above when collagen production really starts to slow.  If you are wanting to target fine lines and wrinkles, as well as brightening the skins complexion over time this could be for you. Physical exfoliation from home products can be good for reducing acne scarring, for a more powerful effect a treatment like microdermabrasion or micro-needling would be more effective from a professional. . .  This product retails for £42.00 which is what you’d expect for Estée Lauder. . . .  #maleskincare #skincaretips #skincarejunkie #skincareuk #acne #acnepositivity #acnetreatment #acnescars #beauty #makeup #hyram #esteelauder #skincareroutine #exfoliate #exfoliateyourskin #microdermabrasion #microneedling #skin #collagen",
