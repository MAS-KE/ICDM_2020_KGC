I make sure I have products to support all 3 areas. . .  Today it’s neck cream. I am not totally experienced in a range of products for the neck but what I do know is that it requires protection just like your face! How many times do you see celebrity’s (or just people you know) with a smooth face but a wrinkly neck! Guess what it’s probably because they forget to to treat that with products and in particular an SPF! Just like your face, your neck requires sun protection too to slow down the signs of ageing.  The product itself is really quite creamy in texture- I’m not entirely happy with the full ingredient list (fragrance cough cough) but I can live with it providing it isn’t giving me irritation. . . The product retails for £70.00 for a 50ml. You will tend to find that neck creams are more expensive. . .  Let me know if you get inspired to find a neck cream! . . .  #neckcream #neck #spf50 #spf #lookyounger #lookyoungerlonger #lookyoungernaturally #skincareuk #maleskincare #gayskincare #esteelauder #estée #acnepositivity",

In my opinion this is definitely a more feminine scent. The lime, mint and musk stand out, making it a really fresh and unique scent and brings to mind the most beautiful summer.  It's a real pick me up scent - thanks to the citrus and floral chords you will feel the unique freshness where after a moment the charming woody notes and precious musk will seduce you and stay with you for a long time. Special combination of light and clear aromas will draw attention and improve the mood.

That meant I needed to find a used pair, in good condition, for a solid price. And I searched far and wide. Prices skyrocketed after #TheLastDance. Eventually, @sbmitchdotcom got a 2011 pair in a beater box, in my size. When I saw the price, I had to jump on it. Like with any older Jordan 3, there was some paint cracking on the midsole, that I figured I could quickly just cover up. My OCD led me to decide to do it the right way...by stripping and repainting the entire midsole. I even repainted the back tab. I’m glad I did it this way, because I’m super happy with how they turned out. They look almost brand new. Once again proving that you don’t always have to pay obscene prices to get something you want. Really glad to have these in my collection.  ______________________________________________________________________ #kicks #kicksonfire #kickstagram #sneakerhead #sneakers #sneakeraddict #sneakerporn #airjordan #nike #sales #discounts #airjordan3 #jordan3 #blackcement #blackcement3s #bc3 #jordan #jordans #michaeljordan #likemike #mjmondays #mensfashion #womensfashion #snkrs #hypestyle #nicekicks #highsnobiety #complexsneakers #yoursneakersaredope",

In my opinion, this is probably the best foundation for not moving too much under my glasses. I do still wear powder with this foundation because I am hella oily on my t-zone 😂 In recent years I have used double wear to mix with other foundations as well, to increase the longevity of wear and add coverage 👌🏻 £34 for a 30ml bottle, a little goes a long way!

It's complimentary and you have no obligation to buy any of the products but for me who was dead set on smelling like peonys, this was brilliant. It's like a blind scent tasting (if that makes sense?) I ended up hating Peony Suede and going with a combination of Jasmine and Orange. I love trying new things and sometimes having the labels removed and not being told what you're trying is a great way to explore new scents. - H . . . . . #huntingformagic #acolorstory #slowsunday #slowsundayevening #composeandgather #goldenhour #jomalone #garden #bohostyle #boho #pottery #cosyvibes #jungalowstyle #vintage #parisianstyle #frenchmood #hygge #wedding #postitfortheaesthetic #flatlay #bride #ptod #lbloggers #mayitbesunday #beigepallet #styled #mybeigelife #beigeaesthetic",

McDonald's has kicked off its Christmas campaign, which tells the story of Father Christmas and his reindeer as they go door to door on Christmas Eve .  The 90-second spot, created by Leo Burnett, launches today (18 November). It continues last year's #ReindeerReady theme .  While visiting each house, Father Christmas keeps himself going with a steady supply of mince pies, but his reindeers are left without any treats .  A dedicated website will give consumers the chance to win McDonald’s festive merchandise and decorations, as well as download an animated Christmas e-book .  As part of the campaign, McDonald’s has created a Snapchat filter through which users can turn their face into reindeer. In a Christmas game on the same social platform, users can try to catch falling carrots .  McDonald’s is also bringing back its augmented-reality app, Reindeer Ready Live, which allows users to make films that appear to show reindeers are visiting their front rooms . #mcdonald #reindeer #areyoureindeerready #adv #adv2019 #christmasadv #campaign #dailymktg #dailymarketing #marketing #marketingadvertising #advertising",

I picked this up because I adore mac products especially their lip products and this did not disappoint at all and was exactly what I was looking for.  This product is a sugar based exfoliator that is very gentle against the lips and gets rid of excess skin which is perfect for prepping the lips before you apply lipstick.  I have it in candied nectar and it is available in three flavours: Candied nectar Fruit or passion  Sweet vanilla  This smells so good that it is good to eat.  You only need a alittle product on your finger and you just gently rub it onto your lips.  Then you just wash off the excess or wipe off with a wipe and lips will feel smooth and alittle plumped.  You only need to use this once or twice a week and you will definitely see a difference in your lips. Price £14 @maccosmetics  Rating 8/10  Pros: only need a little bit of the product, smells very fresh and very hydrating on the lips. Cons: alittle expensive for the size.  #mac #maccosmetics #lips #liphydration #drylips #reviews #honestreviews #selfcare #flakylips #skincareforlips #careforlips #moisturinglips #lipscrub #lipscrubtious #lipscrubtiousmac #candiednectarlipscrub #geniunereviewsposted #geniune #makeup #careforyourlips #reviewsreviewsreviews #reviewer #skin #skincare #loveskin",

Her Autobiography book is out and couldn't wait to read one..! Pomelo is ❤️, the dark side of citrus, clean, feminine yet a lil bit of masculine scent on it, beautifully done and created by the Master of Perfume, Jo Malone herself. Perfect for all season I must say. And can't wait to indulge my self to #FragranceDiscoveryGiftExperience when you buy a bottle of your favourite perfume plus the small bottles to try and discover all her perfume range.  A treat for myself after working this lonnnggg beautiful summer holiday..! 😌  PS: I have encountered this perfume before on a party and couldn't resist myself to ask the girl what perfume she was wearing, she said Jo Loves, Pomelo. It ‘s been always always on the back of my head & that one day I'll go and check it out. I'm so happy I did.  I am not sure but maybe a fumie person can actually relate to me the satisfaction when you smell a perfect scent. It's like the big \"O\" 🙊or the \"hmmmm\" in every bite of your favourite food.

From traveling in Spain to my New York life. ⠀ ⠀ I quite enjoy their collection of scents. Some are questionable but I love their classic ones “Wood Sage & Sea Salt”, “Peony & Blush Suede” and “Blackberry & Bay”. I can’t wear one perfume all time - so I rotate them depending on my mood. I feel that perfume completes the look and adds individuality. Some scents you connect with one person and it’s becomes their “business card”. So, sometimes perfume can become part of your branding. Not for me though - I love to rotate them. ⠀ ⠀ Have you tried Jo Malone? Or do you prefer other brands? What’s your favorite perfume for summer time?",

I’m the type of gal that buys a lot of fragrances because I find that my scent mood shifts with each day depending on what I plan to do.  Since I buy so many fragrances I tend to buy minis because they are inexpensive and I use them before they go bad.  Here are a few scents I love and how I like to use them: . . Layering Scents:  The @glossier You and @escentric_molecules Molecule One are amazing on their own since they morph with your own pheromones producing a unique scent to each person.  Yet!  Using them with one of your favorite perfumes will create a highly unique and favorable scent. . Oils/Aromatherapy Rollers:  These are my go to types of fragrances because I use them when I plan on being highly active.  They sort of just blend into your skin leaving such a deep, yet gentle scent.  These are NOT overbearing and are quite relaxing.  If you are prone to getting headaches due to strong scents then oils are for you.  Great for an office where you work closely with a lot of people, have a sweaty exercise, or to want to smell nice in bed. I always have a soothing lavender or energizing citrus oil in my stash. @aromatherapyassociates makes the most beautiful scents! . Mini Perfumes:  Like I said above, I love mini perfumes because I can really change up my scent daily without the perfume going bad if I don’t use it up in time.  These are the types I layer on top of the personal perfumes like Glossier You or Escentric Molecule One to make it my own. My favorite long last brands are @lancomeofficial @jomalonelondon and @commodity . How do all of you beautiful humans feel about layering scents or wearing a different one each day? 💜 . . #perfume #perfumecollection #glossieryou #glossier #escentricmolecules #one #essentialoils #rollerball #crystals #lancome #mini #miniperfume #fragrance #aromatherapy #aromatherapyassociates #idole #levieestbelle #goldenearth #jomalone #peonyandblushsuede #nectar #commodity",

I went for the BBQ Jack n Cheese with a side order for southern fried nuggets and they’re both winners for me! I was really tempted to get the stuffed cheese crust but didn’t know if that was a bit much, has anyone else tried it? You can grab a pizza, side and drink for £14.99 which I think is really good and it gets delivered straight to your door.

I've been reaching these past few days for Clean Reserves Sueded Oud scent which is, as the name suggests, a woody scent but its a light and fresh one. I've also been following the base of this with a single spray on each wrist of the Jo Malone Garden Lilies cologne. I'm not usually into a floral scent but this is quite fresh and the Clean Reserve underneath adds enough of the woody note to balance the floral (I mixed this with Jo Malone Wood Sage and Sea Salt before I finished that one!) To be 100% honest I definitely bought this because it was part of the Bloomsbury Group collection that Jo Malone did and my dedication to Virginia Woolf meant I rushed out to buy the set of 5 fragrances in its entirity based on the theme, rather than because I particularly cared for the fragrances themselves because that was something problematically spendy me did before I embraced the #beautyrehab life 🤦🏼‍♀️ . . . . . . #makeuprehabaccount #beautyrehabaccount #makeuprehab #beautynobuy #beautynospend #jomalone #cleanreserve #jomalonebloomsbury #thebloomsburygroup #thebloomsburyset #virginiawoolf #perfume #hotweatherperfume #warmweatherperfume #nobuyyear #nobuyyearjourney #nobuyyear2020 #nobuy2020 #beautynobuy #beautynobuy2020",

So I thought I’d take a quick snap of some of my all time fave products with the evening light bouncing off them.  @jomalonelondon, Peony & Blush Suede is one of my absolute favourite perfumes and probably the one I would recommend if you were buying your first JM fragrance. The @juicycouture Majestic Woods scent is so stunning, it’s deep, musky and intense, which I love for Autumn/Winter and dinners out (whenever that will be again). I adore the @diormakeup Lip Addict Lip Tattoos as they’re a liquid lip stain, which lasts for hours and perfect for the day when you want to wear something but don’t want lipstick or gloss when you’re looking after baba.  @cliniqueuk Beyond Perfecting Super Concealer is amazing at covering anything! @ctilburymakeup Pillow Talk lipstick is my most worn lip product ever and I love their face palettes.  I normally post these little reviews on my stories but I’m going to start including some more beauty into my main grid because I adore photographing beauty products and love a good review 💫  #beautyreview #goldenhourphotography #ctilburymakeup #bobbibrown #jomalone #diormakeup #makeupreviews",

Even when fibre/macros/calories are in check if you think these two meals will make you feel/perform the same then I'm losing the will to fight. No, A big mac won't kill you or make you fat BUT just analyse how you feel after eating one compared to a more nutritious meal and tell me they're the same. More than anything though I detest this message/comparison because people who are uneducated on nutrition will now see this and think \"it's OK provided I hit my numbers\" and run with it, eating s*** like this too frequently. Eating \"well\" is REALLY all about common sense, common sense tells you this comparison is flawed. #supersaturdays #stebarlowpersonaltraining #trainedbystebarlow #mcdonalds #wigan #imlovingit #nutrition #foods #burger #salad #personaltrainerwigan #wiganpersonaltrainer #healthyeating #iifym #macros #calories #fatloss #weightloss #fatburner",
